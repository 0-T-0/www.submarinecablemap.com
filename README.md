Submarine Cable Map
===================

[![Submarine Cable Map](http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lru2g8MJaV1qcsswzo1_500.png)](http://www.submarinecablemap.com)

[TeleGeography's](http://www.telegeography.com) submarine cable map is based on our authoritative [Global Bandwidth](http://www.telegeography.com/research-services/global-bandwidth-research-service/) research and depicts international active and planned submarine cable systems and their landing stations. The map presents data about each cable, including landing points, owners, length, ready-for-service (RFS) date, and website. Try it today!

How did you make the Submarine Cable Map?
-------------------------------

[TeleGeography](http://www.telegeography.com) draws the cable routes and plots the landing points with [Adobe Illustrator](http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html). Using [Avenza's MAPublisher](http://www.avenza.com/mapublisher) plug-in, which works with Illustrator, two sets of data are exported as KML files: the cable routes (as MultiLineStrings) and landing points (as Points). These KML files are then parsed to create CSV files that are uploaded to Google Fusion Tables.

We use [Google's Maps API v3.](http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/) to transform the [Google Fusion Tables](http://www.google.com/fusiontables) into two separate map layers of cable routes and landing points. The interactivity on the map is driven by javascript and was written in-house at TeleGeography.


How can I download the KML or a CSV of the dataset?
--------------------------------------------------

Below are links to both of the datasets used for the [Submarine Cable Map](http://www.submarinecablemap.com).
